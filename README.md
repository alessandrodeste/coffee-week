This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Nice to have / brainstorming

- react prop types
- animations
- test unit/int/e2e
- test ie / polyfill
- handling the filter on url level (e.g. coffee/ny/engineering)
- browser specific changes (css, js)
- css theme standards (units, breakpoints, colors, fonts, ...)
- extract and refactor constants and configurations
- store random seeds (on local storage), to handle the shuffle manually instead refreshing the page
- filter the list server side (how can I know the list of departments/location?)
- scope better css in components (for example with emotion.io)
- implement aria and accessibility
- custom component for select and checkbox with custom styles
- improve the loader
