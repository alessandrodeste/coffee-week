## Nice to have / brainstorming

- react prop types
- store random seeds (local storage?), to handle the shuffle manually instead than on refresh
- animations
- improve generalise logic for department
- test unit/int/e2e
- test ie / polyfill
- scope better css in components (emotion.io?)
- css theme standards (units, breakpoints, colors, fonts, ...)
- implement aria and accessibility
- browser specific changes (css, js)
- custom component for select and checkbox with custom styles
